Chapter 2 - Learning to Push to GitHub

We have learned the commands to push our files to github in three commands

1. git add.
2. git commit -m "CommentAboutCommit"
3. git push origin "BranchName"


To update the last changes in my local environment you need to follow this steps:
1. Go to main branch
2. git pull --all
